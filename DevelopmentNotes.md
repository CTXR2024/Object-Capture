### Issue

### [JIRA Ticket Number](xxxxxxx): Data Binding Error
- **Problem Description**: The app crashes when trying to bind data from the view model to a SwiftUI view.
- **Solution**: Ensure all data binding operations are executed on the main thread, this can be achieved by inserting `DispatchQueue.main.async` before updating the data.

### Confusing
### [JIRA Ticket Number](xxxxxxx): Task & MainThread

### [TIW-84](https://chancetop.atlassian.net/browse/TIW-84): Collapse SideBar Not Work
- **Problem Description**:<br/> 
<body>I added NavigationView to the root view to try to achieve better interaction (left and right views can be more freely scaled or expanded) and introduced TitleBar.</body>

```
 NavigationView {
    //Sidebar
    //ModelViewer
    ...
 }
 .toolbar {
   ToolbarItem(placement: .navigation) {
   Button(action: toggleSidebar) {
Â     Label(String(localized: "ToggleSidebar",comment: "Button: Toggles Sidebar"),systemImage: "sidebar.left")
   }
 }
...
func toggleSidebar() {
   NSApp.keyWindow?.firstResponder?.tryToPerform(#selector(NSSplitViewController.toggleSidebar(_:)), with: nil)
}
```
<body>However, when I click the toggle button on the titlelebar, the Sidebar doesn't collaspse properly!</body>

- **Solution**:<br/>
<body>
  <p>NavigationView is deprecated! Details refer to <a href=https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/navigationview>this</a></p>
  <p>So I replaced Navigation with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/navigationsplitview">NavigationSpiltView</a>In addition, NavigationSpiltView comes with a toggle to collapse and expand the left sidebar.</p>
  <p>Please check the <a href=ObjectCapture/Views/Sidebar.swift>Sidebar.swif</a></p>
</body>
