## Project Overview
In the first phase of the workshop, we expected to get a basic understanding of Apple's AR ecosystem, so we chose this entry point. After watching the official introduction [video](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10076) of WWDC 2021, we decided to develop a desktop application. It utilizes Object Capture to generate 3D models, thus providing us with the ability to model.

## Learning Objectives
- Learn to write macOS applications using Swift
- Learn more about how to [create 3d objects from photographs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/RealityKit/creating-3d-objects-from-photographs)
- Master the [PhotogrammetrySession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/photogrammetrysession)
- Understand the implementation of concurrent programming

## Development Environment Setup

- **Operating System**: macOS Sonama 14.0 or above
- **Development Tool**: Xcode 15.0.0 or above
- **Dependency Management Tool**: Swift Package Manager

## Challenges and Solutions
The team was not experienced enough in SwiftUI development, so we encountered a variety of problems during the development process, I hereby record some of the problems we encountered during the development as well as my thoughts, so that developers can have a quick reference to solve the same problems we encountered!

Our team also encountered some problems during the development of this desktop application, as well as confusion and thoughts about the use of SwiftUI, please refer to [Issues](DevelopmentNotes.md).
